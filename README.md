- We ran a Full Pipeline from preprocessing the data and then selecting the k important features and then giving that data to the models.
- We also experimented with a Support Vector Machine Regressor by tuning its parameters and found a best one which is giving less RMSE value.
- We also compared(with graphs and charts) the SVR regressor with Linear Regression, Decesion Tree Regression and Random Forest Regression.
